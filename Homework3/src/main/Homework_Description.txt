•	Download dataset (web-server access log): https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4eU5TenoBPjZllmdTVfRS1xSE0/view?usp=sharing

•	write MR jobs to count average bytes per request by IP and total bytes by IP (try to use combiner); output is CSV file with rows as next:
IP,175.5,109854
•	Run your job and make screenshot #1
•	Add MR Unit tests for your Mapper/Reducer
•	Modify previous MR job to use custom Writable data type
•	Save output as Sequence file compressed with Snappy (key is IP, and value is custom object for avg and total size)
•	Use counters to get stats how many users of IE, Mozzila or Other were detected (parse it from UserAgent: ip13 - - [24/Apr/2011:04:41:53 -0400] "GET /logs/access_log.3 HTTP/1.1" 200 4846545 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Googlebot/2.1; +http://www.google.com/bot.html)") and print them in STDOUT of Driver and make screenshot #2
•	Read content of compressed file from console using command line: hadoop fs –libjars <custom-jar> -text <src-on-hdfs> and make screenshot #3
